TODO:
 - Use the PTHotKey classes from the Adium project to manage the HUD hot key
 - Allow editing of the hotkey combo
 - Show chats inside the HUD
 - Ability to initiate a chat from the HUD. Contact list inside the HUD
 - Fade out HUD on dismiss
 - Make the HUD a true borderless window. The title bar isn't really in the way, but it's not doing much good.
